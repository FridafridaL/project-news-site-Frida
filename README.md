# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

Title: Art News

My plan is to make a news site about art. I will focus on on the coding and layout. This is really new to me so I will focus on trying understand how all this works.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

When I got problems I started to google at first. If i didn't find a clear answer quickly I looked in Stacked overflow if someone asked my question before. So far I got through my problems this way.

sources I've been using:
-w3school
-slack
-using the info in the precourse over and over again
-google
-Q&A meeting

Margin around the dokument in the browser.
During the Q&A I learned about the reset tag to use in the css file. This took away the preinstalled margins and styling that comes with chrome amongs other. When I added this it solved alot of small problems I couldn't understand. 
It also made some other problems that I now can't solve. More about that below.

I didn't understand at first that I should start to build for phones so I started with layout for desktop. When I did came to media queries I've already did so much my media queries is for phone and tablet. I'm aware that it should be the other way around.

I realised that often when i got stuck with something and one thing worked but when I did it again it didn't work, I've missed a letter or something like that in the html file. It took me a while when I was looking but when I found it and solved the problem it was often a simple thing like that.

Problem Logo header:
When I added the reset tag in the beginning of the css file ( copied it from the Q&A meeting) some other problems around the header got fixet. But the logo that was in the left corner is now missing and I can't make it to show up in the header.

Images:
the images in .articles grid seem to load slow in my browser, are they to heavy in some way and should I save them differently?



background:
When the content gets longer my background doesn't follow, it repeats itself. how can I make it "grow" with the content?

I've tried with diffrent options in background-size and background-repeat.

Text:
I don't really find a good way to edit text. I don't really understand how I should structure it. Is it best to make one box for the heading of a text?
I tried some diffrent things but it didn't turn out very well. 
How to structure text inside a div class. When I used h2 and p inside a class it all got very wierd.

Media quires:
I don't get the content to flow correctly with the responsive design. It just look wierd..

------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

Next time I need to build a good groundstructure in how I want it to look like. This time I was a bit eager to fill up with content and understand how it all worked. I feel my way of working with this has been a bit messy and hopefully I can become better at that(eaven if I'm a messy person:)

It's not yet all clear to me what overrules what in all cases and and wich tags that's best to choose in different cases, for example: div or section.
