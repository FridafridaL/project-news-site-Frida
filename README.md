Bulid a News website and learn HTML and CSS coding

## The problem

sources I've been using when I got problems:
-w3school
-slack
-using the info in the precourse over and over again
-google
-Q&A meeting



Margin around the dokument in the browser.
During the Q&A I learned about the reset tag to use in the css file. This took away the preinstalled margins and styling that comes with chrome amongs other. When I added this it solved alot of small problems I couldn't understand. 



I realised that often when i got stuck with something and one thing worked but when I did it again it didn't work, I've missed a letter or something like that in the html file. It took me a while when I was looking but when I found it and solved the problem it was often a simple thing like that.


Conclusion:

Next time I need to build a good groundstructure in how I want it to look like. This time I was a bit eager to fill up with content and understand how it all worked. I feel my way of working with this has been a bit messy and hopefully I can become better at that.
